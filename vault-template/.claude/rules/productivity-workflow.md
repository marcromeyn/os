# Productivity Workflow Rules

These conventions apply to goal files and daily notes.

## Goal Cascade Principle

Goals flow from long-term vision to daily actions:
```
3-Year Vision (life direction)
    → Yearly Goals (annual objectives)
        → Monthly Goals (current focus)
            → Weekly Review (this week's plan)
                → Daily Tasks (today's actions)
```

## Goal Setting Standards

### SMART Goals
Every goal should be:
- **S**pecific - Clear and well-defined
- **M**easurable - Has quantifiable outcomes
- **A**chievable - Realistic given constraints
- **R**elevant - Aligned with higher-level goals
- **T**ime-bound - Has a deadline

### Goal Limits
- Maximum 3 active high-priority goals at once
- Each goal should have clear success criteria
- Goals without action in 14+ days need review

## Daily Planning Rules

### Morning (5 minutes)
1. Create daily note or open existing
2. Identify ONE Big Thing for the day
3. Review yesterday's incomplete tasks
4. Set realistic time blocks

### The ONE Thing
> "What's the ONE thing I can do today such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?"

Always answer this question in the Focus section.

### Task Prioritization
1. Must Do Today - Non-negotiable, deadline-driven
2. Should Do - Important but flexible timing
3. Could Do - Nice to have if time permits
4. Won't Do - Explicitly dropped (acknowledge trade-offs)

## Weekly Review Rules

### When: Sunday or Monday
### Duration: 30 minutes minimum

### Required Elements
1. **Collect** - Gather all loose ends
2. **Process** - Decide on each item
3. **Review** - Check goal progress
4. **Plan** - Set next week's priorities

### Checklist
- [ ] All inboxes emptied
- [ ] All daily notes from week reviewed
- [ ] Goal progress calculated
- [ ] Next week's ONE Big Thing identified
- [ ] Calendar reviewed for commitments

## Progress Tracking

### Checkbox Format
```markdown
- [ ] Not started
- [/] In progress (optional)
- [x] Completed
```

### Percentage Updates
Update percentages when progress is made:
```markdown
- [ ] Learn Spanish (25% → 30%)
```

### Milestone Dates
Record significant progress:
```markdown

```

## Time Management

### Time Blocks
Structure days around energy:
- 🌅 Morning: High-focus work (9-12)
- ☀️ Afternoon: Meetings, admin (12-5)
- 🌙 Evening: Light tasks, learning (5+)

### Energy Tracking
Log energy levels daily (1-10):
```markdown
**Energy:** 7/10 - Good morning, afternoon slump
```

## Archive Rules

Move to Archives when:
- Project completed
- Goal achieved or abandoned
- Daily notes older than 30 days (optional)

Archive format:
```
