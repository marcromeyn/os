## 🧠 Output Styles

This starter kit includes a **Productivity Coach** output style that transforms Claude into an accountability partner. The coach will:

- Challenge you to clarify your true intentions
- Point out misalignments between stated goals and actions
- Ask powerful questions to drive momentum
- Hold you accountable to your commitments
- Help you identify and overcome resistance

To use the coach style in Claude Code:
1. The output style is automatically included in `.claude/output-styles/`
2. Start Claude Code and type `/output-style` to select from available styles
3. Or directly activate with: `/output-style coach`
4. The style preference is automatically saved for your project

Learn more about [customizing output styles](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md#output-styles).

## 🤖 Custom Agents (v2.0)

Ask Claude to use specialized agents for common PKM tasks:

```bash
# Organize your vault and fix broken links
claude "Use the note-organizer agent to audit my vault"

# Facilitate weekly review aligned with goals
claude "Use the weekly-reviewer agent for my weekly review"

# Check if daily work aligns with long-term goals
claude "Use the goal-aligner agent to analyze my recent activity"

# Process inbox items using GTD principles
claude "Use the inbox-processor agent to clear my inbox"
```

## 🔄 Upgrading from v1.x

If you have an existing vault from v1.x:

```bash
# 1. Copy new directories to your vault
cp -r vault-template/.claude-plugin your-vault/
cp -r vault-template/.claude/agents your-vault/.claude/
cp -r vault-template/.claude/skills your-vault/.claude/
cp -r vault-template/.claude/hooks your-vault/.claude/
cp -r vault-template/.claude/rules your-vault/.claude/
cp -r vault-template/.claude/scripts your-vault/.claude/
cp vault-template/.claude/settings.json your-vault/.claude/
cp vault-template/CLAUDE.local.md.template your-vault/

# 2. Review and merge CLAUDE.md changes
# Your customizations are preserved, just add references to new features

# 3. Make hook scripts executable
chmod +x your-vault/.claude/hooks/*.sh
chmod +x your-vault/.claude/scripts/*.sh
```
