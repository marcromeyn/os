### Tag Combinations
Use multiple tags for powerful filtering:

```

## Claude Commands

### Creating Custom Commands

#### Example: Book Notes Command
Create `.claude/commands/book.md`:
```markdown
# Book Notes Creator

Creates a new book note with metadata and structure.

## Usage
claude code /book "Book Title" "Author"

## What it does
1. Creates note in Resources/Books/
2. Adds metadata (title, author, date started)
3. Includes template for notes
4. Links to reading list
```

#### Example: Meeting Notes Command
Create `.claude/commands/meeting.md`:
```markdown
# Meeting Notes

Creates formatted meeting notes with action items.

## Usage
claude code /meeting "Meeting Title"

## Template
- Date/Time
- Attendees
- Agenda
- Discussion
- Action Items
- Follow-up
```

### Modifying Existing Commands

#### Daily Command for Different Schedules
Edit `.claude/commands/daily.md`:
```javascript
// For night shift workers
const DAILY_NOTES_TIME = "18:00"; // 6 PM start

// For early risers
const MORNING_ROUTINE_START = "05:00";

// For parents
const INCLUDE_FAMILY_SECTION = true;
```

## Output Styles

### Using the Productivity Coach

The included Productivity Coach style transforms Claude into an accountability partner:

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# Then choose your output style:
/output-style              # Opens interactive menu to select a style
/output-style coach        # Directly activates the coach style

# Example interaction with coach:
# You: "I'm procrastinating on my report"
# Coach: "What's the smallest action you could take right now that would create momentum?"
```

Your style preference is automatically saved to `.claude/settings.local.json` for the current project.

### Creating Custom Output Styles

Create new personality modes in `.claude/output-styles/`:

```bash
# Quick way to create a new style:
/output-style:new I want a style that acts as a technical mentor

# Or manually create files in .claude/output-styles/
```

#### Example: Technical Mentor
Create `.claude/output-styles/mentor.md`:
```markdown
---

---

You are a experienced technical mentor who helps users learn and grow. Focus on:

- Breaking down complex concepts into understandable pieces
- Providing examples and analogies
- Encouraging experimentation and learning from mistakes
- Suggesting resources for deeper learning

Always teach the "why" behind the "how".
```

#### Example: Creative Brainstormer
Create `.claude/output-styles/creative.md`:
```markdown
---
name: Creative Brainstormer  
description: Expansive thinking and idea generation

- "Yes, and..." thinking to build on ideas
- Asking "What if?" questions
- Making unexpected connections
- Challenging assumptions playfully
- Generating multiple alternatives
- Embracing wild possibilities before filtering

No idea is too crazy in brainstorming mode!
```
