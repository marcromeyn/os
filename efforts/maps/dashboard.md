# Efforts Dashboard

Manage your efforts by energy level. Move notes between folders as your focus shifts.

## Energy Levels

|--------|--------|-------------|
| On | `efforts/on/` | Active focus - high energy required |
| Ongoing | `efforts/ongoing/` | Continuous work - steady energy |
| Simmering | `efforts/simmering/` | Back-burner - occasional attention |
| Sleeping | `efforts/sleeping/` | Future ideas - no current energy |
| Archive | `efforts/archive/` | Completed - reference only |
